# Loops

To understand conditional statements, we imagined the JavaScript interpreter following a branching path through your source code. The `looping` statements are those that bend that path back upon itself to repeat portions of your code.

**JavaScript has five looping statements:**

1. `while`,
2. `do/while`,
3. `for`,
4. `for/of` (and its `for/await` variant), and
5. `for/in`.

The following subsections explain each in turn. One common use for loops is to iterate over the elements of an array. discusses this kind of loop in detail and covers special looping methods defined by the Array class.
